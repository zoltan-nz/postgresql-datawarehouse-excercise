\echo ---------------------------------
\echo Question 1 - Creating TIME table.
\echo ---------------------------------
\echo

-- Create time table
\echo Creating time table

CREATE TABLE time
(
  TimeId    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  OrderDate DATE               NOT NULL,
  DayOfWeek VARCHAR(10)        NOT NULL,
  Month     VARCHAR(10)        NOT NULL,
  Year      INT                NOT NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX time_TimeId_uindex ON time (TimeId);

-- Populate time table

INSERT INTO time (OrderDate, DayOfWeek, Month, Year)
  SELECT DISTINCT

    to_char(cust_order.orderdate, 'Day')    AS DayOfWeek,
    to_char(cust_order.orderdate, 'Month')  AS Month,
    extract(YEAR FROM cust_order.orderdate) AS Year

\echo Time table is updated, number of records:

\echo Creating and uploading sales table

\echo ---------------------------------
\echo Question 2 - Aggregate Queries
\echo ---------------------------------
\echo

\echo Calculating averages from averages - WRONG!

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW avg_amnt_view AS
  SELECT
    CustomerId,
    avg(Amnt) AS avg_amnt
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY customerid;

SELECT avg(avg_amnt) FROM avg_amnt_view;

\echo In this case we calculate the average of all individual transactions, so this number is the average amount of transactions:
\echo
SELECT avg(amnt) FROM sales;

\echo
\echo Update! Later, when I got more accurate information about what we should calculate, and need average based on all the three dimensions, I realized the above answer is right. So I just leave here the following calculation what I did for two dimensions.
\echo

-- Find the average amount of money spent by all customers on buying books for all days so far.

\echo We are looking for the average amount of money spent by all customers for all days, so first we have to create a intermediate tuple.
\echo
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sum_customer_per_day AS
  SELECT
    customerid,
    timeid,
    sum(amnt) AS amnt_spent_daily_by_customers
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY customerid, timeid;

\echo We have 198 unique customer-day tuple, so we can calculate an average.
\echo
SELECT avg(amnt_spent_daily_by_customers) AS avg_spending_by_customers_per_day FROM sum_customer_per_day;

\echo
\echo Or we can calculate from the other direction. First creatin a materialized view which list the average spending by customer each day and using this avg and count to calculate our final daily avg spending.
\echo

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW avg_spending_by_customer_on_each_day AS
  SELECT
    timeid,
    count(customerid)                                       AS number_of_customer_a_day,
    avg(sum_customer_per_day.amnt_spent_daily_by_customers) AS avg_spending FROM sum_customer_per_day
  GROUP BY timeid;

SELECT
  sum(avg_spending_by_customer_on_each_day.avg_spending * avg_spending_by_customer_on_each_day.number_of_customer_a_day)
  / sum(avg_spending_by_customer_on_each_day.number_of_customer_a_day) AS Total_AVG
FROM avg_spending_by_customer_on_each_day;

\echo

\echo
\echo a) Customer idâ€™s, names and surnames of five customers who spent the largest amount of money buying books:
\echo

SELECT
  customer.CustomerId AS customer_id,
  customer.f_name     AS first_name,
  customer.l_name     AS last_name,
  sum(amnt)           AS spending
