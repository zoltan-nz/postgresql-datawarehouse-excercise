\echo Calculating averages from averages - WRONG!

\echo Update! Later, when I got more accurate information about what we should calculate, and need average based on all the three dimensions, I realized the above answer is right. So I just leave here the following calculation what I did for two dimensions.
\echo

-- Find the average amount of money spent by all customers on buying books for all days so far.
